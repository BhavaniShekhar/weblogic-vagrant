WebLogic Vagrant
================

The WebLogic Vagrant project is a set of subprojects that will help you create virtual machines pretty easily, by using Vagrant to set up the VMs with VirtualBox, and Puppet to help creating the necessary logical infrastructure. Please feel free to fork and pull your Vagrant+Puppet configuration for WebLogic.

At the moment, we have two projects:

* [wls11g-centos|https://github.com/weblogic-community/weblogic-vagrant/tree/master/wls11g-centos] will give you a WebLogic 11g 10.3.6 Virtual Machine on CentOS 6.5-x86_64
* [wls12c-solaris-clustered|https://github.com/weblogic-community/weblogic-vagrant/tree/master/wls12c-solaris-cluster] will give you two clustered VMs with WebLogic 12c 12.1.2 on Solaris 10 x86_64

If you have any questions, contact the members of the WebLogic Community here on GitHub.
